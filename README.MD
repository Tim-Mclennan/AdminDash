## <a name="Project-Structure">Project Structure</a>

The project is structured around the Refine framework's best practices, with the 'src' directory containing the main application code, including pages, components, and utilities. The public directory contains static assets like the index.html file and images.

## <a name="Features">Features</a>

AdminDashboard is designed to streamline the management and operational tasks of businesses through its intuitive interface and powerful features. Two key features of this application are the Company List and Task Pages, which are essential for users who need to manage company-related data and tasks efficiently.

### Company List Page

The Company List page is a central feature that allows users to view, search, and manage a list of companies. This page is built to handle large datasets, providing features such as pagination, sorting, and filtering to help users navigate through the company data effortlessly. Users can also add new companies, edit existing ones, or delete them if necessary. This page is crucial for users who need to keep track of multiple companies and their details within the AdminDashboard.

### Task Pages

The Task Pages are designed to help users manage their daily, weekly, or project-based tasks. Almost identical to a Kanban board, these pages allow for the creation, assignment, tracking, and completion of tasks. Features include setting deadlines, priorities, and assigning tasks to specific team members. The Task Pages are highly customizable, enabling users to categorize tasks based on projects, urgency, or any other criteria that suit their workflow. This feature is particularly useful for project managers and teams looking to streamline their task management processes.
